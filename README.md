# Connascent Cakes

Connascent Cakes is an artisan cake shop that sells custom-made cakes for delivery. Two friends, Sandro and Marco, own the shop.

Sandro and Marco want to start selling cakes online and need you to write code that can calculate the delivery date for their cakes.

# The kata

The requirements for the kata are in `requirements.md` and have worked examples in `examples.md` (hint: these might make good test cases).

Often in software, the requirements we're asked to implement seem simple, but the interaction between them makes the code complicated. Try working through the requirements in order, refactoring your code as you go to try and keep the solution simple and easy to understand.

There are starting points provided for Typescript and Python.

# Contributing

If you'd like to submit another language, or an amendment to the requirements and examples, pull requests are very much welcomed.
